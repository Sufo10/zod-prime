# Contributing to zod-prime

We love your input! We want to make contributing to zod-prime as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
4. Make your changes with proper TypeScript types and JSDoc comments
5. Add tests for any new functionality
6. Run the full test suite with coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
7. Make sure your code lints and formats: `npm run lint && npm run format`
8. Check types with `tsc --noEmit`
9. Create a pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Add JSDoc comments for all exported functions and types
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Keep functions focused and composable
- Maintain type safety without excessive use of `any`

## Testing

- All exports must have test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Include edge cases in tests
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage

## Documentation

- Keep README.md examples up to date
- Document breaking changes
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Add inline comments for complex logic

## Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® (sparkles) for new features
  - üêõ (bug) for fixes
  - üìù (memo) for documentation
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è (recycle) for refactoring
  - üß™ (test tube) for tests
  - üé® (art) for formatting/style
  - ‚ö°Ô∏è (zap) for performance
  - üîß (wrench) for configuration
  - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è (arrow up) for upgrading dependencies
  - ‚¨áÔ∏è (arrow down) for downgrading dependencies
